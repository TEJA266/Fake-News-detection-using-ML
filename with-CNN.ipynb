      "washington  reuters    the head of a conservative republican faction in the u s  congress  who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts  called himself a  fiscal conservative  on sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018  in keeping with a sharp pivot under way among republicans  u s  representative mark meadows  speaking on cbs   face the nation   drew a hard line on federal spending  which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in january  when they return from the holidays on wednesday  lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues  such as immigration policy  even as the november congressional election campaigns approach in which republicans will seek to keep control of congress  president donald trump and his republicans want a big budget increase in military spending  while democrats also want proportional increases for non defense  discretionary  spending on programs that support education  scientific research  infrastructure  public health and environmental protection   the  trump  administration has already been willing to say   we re going to increase non defense discretionary spending     by about 7 percent    meadows  chairman of the small but influential house freedom caucus  said on the program   now  democrats are saying that s not enough  we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent  for a fiscal conservative  i don t see where the rationale is      eventually you run out of other people s money   he said  meadows was among republicans who voted in late december for their party s debt financed tax overhaul  which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about  1 5 trillion over 10 years to the  20 trillion national debt   it s interesting to hear mark talk about fiscal responsibility   democratic u s  representative joseph crowley said on cbs  crowley said the republican tax bill would require the  united states to borrow  1 5 trillion  to be paid off by future generations  to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich   this is one of the least     fiscally responsible bills we ve ever seen passed in the history of the house of representatives  i think we re going to be paying for this for many  many years to come   crowley said  republicans insist the tax package  the biggest u s  tax overhaul in more than 30 years   will boost the economy and job growth  house speaker paul ryan  who also supported the tax bill  recently went further than meadows  making clear in a radio interview that welfare or  entitlement reform   as the party often calls it  would be a top republican priority in 2018  in republican parlance   entitlement  programs mean food stamps  housing assistance  medicare and medicaid health insurance for the elderly  poor and disabled  as well as other programs created by washington to assist the needy  democrats seized on ryan s early december remarks  saying they showed republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs  but the goals of house republicans may have to take a back seat to the senate  where the votes of some democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown  democrats will use their leverage in the senate  which republicans narrowly control  to defend both discretionary non defense programs and social spending  while tackling the issue of the  dreamers   people brought illegally to the country as children  trump in september put a march 2018 expiration date on the deferred action for childhood arrivals  or daca  program  which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits  the president has said in recent twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the dreamers  representative debbie dingell told cbs she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives  such as wall funding   we need to do daca clean   she said   on wednesday  trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues  that will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for trump and republican leaders on jan  6 and 7  the white house said  trump was also scheduled to meet on sunday with florida republican governor rick scott  who wants more emergency aid  the house has passed an  81 billion aid package after hurricanes in florida  texas and puerto rico  and wildfires in california  the package far exceeded the  44 billion requested by the trump administration  the senate has not yet voted on the aid\n",
